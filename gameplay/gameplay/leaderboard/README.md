# Leaderboard

The Mythic Legion: Uprising has 3 different leaderboards for the players to compete in. Each leaderboard attracts different types of players and rewards the winners in a different way thus creating a way for every type of player to have a chance to win big prizes by ranking high in one of the leaderboards.

Leaderboards are reset at the beginning of every season and have a countdown until winners will be announced. Prizes for each leaderboard are known in advance or have a counter to show them as they gain more currency for the prize-pool.

Every Mythic Legion: Uprisingâ€™s season will span about three months (90 days) and during that time, you will be able to grind and work on your rank and track you overall progression within the game.

In Mythical Legion - Uprising, the Leaderboard is divided into three main categories to produce custom difficulties for players to accomplish. Players can see their positions on the leaderboards by selecting a category.
