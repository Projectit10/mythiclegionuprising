Normal Battle in Mythical Legion's initial game mode. The concepts of Normal Battles serve as the foundation for all other game types. It is a 5v5 Open division PVP experience. This implies that even if a player does not win the game, they do not lose their rank title. This mode is appropriate for new players who need to become acquainted with the gaming concepts. They can compete with whatever hero they want. Players, on the other hand, are not supposed to have more than one of the same characters on their team. The opposition team, on the other hand, may select the same character as your lineup.
