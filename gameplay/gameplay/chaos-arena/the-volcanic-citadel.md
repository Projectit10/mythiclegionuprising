### **Searing Dragon Challenge**

While the players are fighting against the servants and protectors of Kifir in his Citadel. the player will take damage (10% HP every 1s) if he edges too much on the Arena since it is surrounded by molten lava and it is inside the volcano. and it can also rain Fire and Lava that can damage (5% of Player’s HP) and burn (20 per seconds) players due to being unstable of this volcano due to Kifir’s Rage during the Battle.

### **Bathala’s Guidance**

If the player is not hit by the opponent for 5 seconds their Attack Damage and Magic Power (6%) will increase every 1s and it can be stacked up to 10, but if the player is hit, all stacks and the buff will be lost.
