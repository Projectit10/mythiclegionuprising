# Gameplay

Every game in Mythical Legion has a total of ten players. All players will be thrown onto the Firipins Land arena set as battlefield for a 5v5 PVP team combat. The map is divided into two equal parts named Sultanaria and Gaoraja. The goal of the game is to Demolish/Destroy the opponent team's base to win the game.&#x20;

There are multiple levels of complexities involved. The layout is extensive and centered on managing lanes. Each lane leads to the other team's base, which is secured by waves of hostile minions and turrets. Surrounding these lanes is a jungle and a riverbed, which players may use tactically to kill strong monsters, flee, ambush, or explore the area discreetly.
