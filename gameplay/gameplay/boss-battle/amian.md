# ðŸŒª Amian

### **The Lone Gale Terror of Tandaya**

A former deity named Amian who had the ability to create strong cold winds. She was once a peaceful deity together with her brother Abag-at who is a deity of rain. Together, they live on a sky palace overseeing and responsible for the wind and rain on the lands of Firipins. Once when a severe drought has been occurring for a long time, people constantly prayed and wished for rain to come, but the deities know that bringing rain during a severe drought is nearly impossible. Her brother Abag-at cared so much for humans that he cannot bring himself to ignore their prayers, he used most of his power to bring the long-awaited rain in the lands; this caused Abag-at to fall sick. Abag-at knew his time is near and gave his power to his sister, eventually losing his life. The incident put Amian to an intense state of anger to human as she blamed them for her brotherâ€™s death. She wanted revenge against humans and brought destructive winds and rain to the villages and turned the climate in a cold state for a while. Suddenly the people saw the sky turned very bright then a beam of light travelled to the sky palace; afterwards, the winds turned calm and the people gradually settled down, hoping that the occurrence would not happen again. Despite for a long time without any sign of Amian, people still felt her presence through cold weather and storms and now people always pray that Amian will not disturb them again.
