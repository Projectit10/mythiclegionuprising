### **The Fire Dragon Who Raged the Land of Raal** &#x20;

A Fire Dragon that lives inside the volcano on an isolated island in the land of Raal, he is the main cause of the eruptions of volcanoes and affects even far away volcanoes around Firipins, causing those to erupt simultaneously on a rare occasion. The people who live here also say that while the volcano is erupting, they also hear the loud scream of Kifir. They can't figure out what is the reason for Kifir's screaming, so the people who live here are scared and nervous that Kifir might sow terror again on the mainland of Raal. As one of the oldest residents said, that when he was a young boy, he saw Kifir coming out of his lair. He heard loud explosions and strong aftershocks from the distance where Kifir went. Then he saw it raging and burning the nearby village and forest. While Kifir was raging, he also saw the light coming from the sky and it cast a beam on Kifir and it weakened Kifir because of the beam of light hitting him and sending him back to his Volcano. After that, they never saw Kifir again. But occasionally they hear Kifir screaming coming from the volcano. At the same time, the volcano becomes active whenever this happens. And as the old man said, "Kifir will come out of his lair once again and sow terror again on the mainland of Raal." the people here keeps praying that Kifir will never disturb them again.
