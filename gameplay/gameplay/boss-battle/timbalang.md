# Timbalang

This boss conquers the mainland of Bulo. A muscular creature that is a half human â€“ half horse that wreaked havoc to his enemies. This boss stomps the ground that causes the area to crack and dazed enemies, it jumps high and upon its impact deals massive damage and stuns enemies, and with its horn can deal lethality with its lunge attack.
