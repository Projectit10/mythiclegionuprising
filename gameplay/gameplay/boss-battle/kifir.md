# ðŸ”¥ Kifir

A boss that reigns in the violent and explosive land of Raal. It is a demonic creature mixed with a dragon and a boar crazed to kill everything on its path. This boss shoots fire upon its mouth and glides through the area with its fiery wings.

### Passive&#x20;

All of Kifirâ€™s attacks will cause Embered Earth: the floor will become molten for a short period of time, dealing 5% Attack as Fire DoT (Damage Over Time). Moreover, Kifirâ€™s attacks will also amplify the accumulation of Blazing Heat Which reduce Healing Bonus for 10% should the player gets hit by them.

### Skills

#### **Hellfire Onslaught:**

**Kifir will unleash its wings to summon a rain of small fireball in front, dealing 25% Attack as AoE (Area of Effect) Fire Damage and leaving Embered Earth.**

#### **Fire Breath:**

**Unleash a breath of pure elemental power, whilst arcing the attack in a cone-like area in front of itself, rapidly dealing 30% Attack, 20% Attack, or 10% Attack as AoE (Area of Effect) Fire Damage and leaving Embered Earth.**

#### **Eruption:**

**Unleashes a blast of pure Fire power in a huge AoE (Area of Effect) around it, dealing 200% Attack as AoE (Area of Effect) Fire Damage. Once Kifir reaches critical health (Approximately less than 10% Max HP), it will always perform the Eruption skill and leaving Embered Earth in huge AoE (Area of Effect).**

#### **Fire Smash:**

Kifir will slam its hand into the ground after locking onto your current position, dealing 25% Attack as AoE (Area of Effect) Fire Damage on impact and sending tremors through the ground and leaving Embered Earth in the direction of its Fire Smash, with each explosion dealing 15% Attack as AoE (Area of Effect) Fire Damage. This attack may be used 3 times in rapid succession.
