Also he’s the reason why peak of this Mountain is always struck by Lightning because of its scattered Pillars and its Kingdom that can attract Lightnings which located in the middle of this Mountain he always uses his violent lightning strikes to frighten the people who live in this Land and the people who live here think of making their walls cement but with his powerful lightning even cement walls that the house of people who live here are still ruined many try to stop Liente but they failed because they were just approaching the mountain where Liente is they will be greeted by loud thunder and lightning strikes around them so many want to leave the Land of Hey because of Liente's sowing of terror among the people living here and while they were packing their belongings they suddenly saw a Light in the sky and it fired a beam of light in Liente's Kingdom and in front of the people here saw that the lightning strikes on this mountain and the sounds of thunder were no longer severe so they had the choice to just stay here in the Land of Hey-an after the incident, the people who lived here just prayed that Liente will never disturb them again but the lightning and thunder did not stop at the top of the mountain where the Storm Clouds rumbling and as long as the grudges of the land do not fade. So will the roaring thunder persist as Liente’s presence in the Land of Hey-an. The people here do not stop praying that Liente will not disturb them again.
