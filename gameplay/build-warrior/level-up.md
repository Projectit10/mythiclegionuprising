# Level Up

In order to level-up a playerâ€™s account and in-game, players will need to earn Experience (also called Experience Points or Exp) by playing the game and earning them as rewards. Level of the account and the in-game level are different from each other. The maximum level of the account will be 30 and the maximum level of a hero in-game will be 15. The hero that the player chose will start at level 1. For the account level, experience gained from games depends in the MMR of the account, in other words, players gain more account experience the more wins they get in ranked games. Compared to ranked games, less experience will be gained in the classic game modes. In-game, players will be able to gain experience when they slay minions, monsters, heroes, and bosses, each of them have a corresponding amount of experience to be gained.

The account of the player can gain from 200 up to 1000 experience every win in the tournament and boss matches depending on the placement in the leaderboards, if players lose in tournament and boss matches they can only gain 100 to 500 experience. In ranked mode, players can get 100 to 150 experience every win, if lost they can only gain 40 to 80 experience to level up their account.

### **Minions**

Because there are different types of minions, players can get a specific amount of experience for each one they slay. Every minion group will appear every 30 seconds and if the game reached the 10 minute mark of gameplay Sage Minions will spawn alongside normal minions and has slightly more experience compared to normal minions.

When the game reached 30 minutes of gameplay or when players destroyed more than 6 turrets, Brute Minions will spawn to fight alongside the groups of minions, these kinds of minions will be in the back of every minion group, in every wave this type of minion will be stronger and harder to kill, if the hero has slain the brute minion the player can gain more experience than normal and sage minions.

Additionally, if there is more than one hero near a minion, the hero who kills the minion will gain the full amount of experience and the other hero/es will only get a portion of experience from the minion, if a minion dies with no hero interaction, all heroes within range can only gain a portion of experience. A slain hero can still gain experience if the minion that the hero interacted with died under 15 seconds.
