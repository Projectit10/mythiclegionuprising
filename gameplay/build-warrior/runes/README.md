# Runes

A Thousand years ago, magical artifacts called ‘Runes’ have been rediscovered. Over the following decades after such event, knowledge of the Runes began to spread as more were unearthed. The world’s brightest minds studied the ancient runes, attempting to determine the powers they possessed. Few could even begin to understand the importance of their origins, or the sheer power held within them. Some surmised that the Runes were integral to the creation of Firipins itself. The first use of these mysterious artifacts proved catastrophic, as they reshaped the landscape of entire nations. Mistrust quickly grew as those who knew of the Runes imagined such “Beholders’ Might” being used as a powerful weapon. Conflicts later related to these magical runes were used in the “Rune Wars” in the Firipins.

Runes were enhancements that the Player provides to their Heroes. This page contains a summary of all runes, their effects, which may be historical in nature.
