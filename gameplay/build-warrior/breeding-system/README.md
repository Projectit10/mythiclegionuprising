# Breeding System

Players can gain LEGION Token and ALON Token in order to breed other heroes and create or possess a powerful hero. Heroes are unable to breed with their children, as well as with their siblings. Depending on the hero's breed count, breeding costs 30 LEGION and ALON costs 2k-10k each breed.

For example, if you have a 0/5 breed count, it will cost you 30 LEGION and 2000 ALON Token. In the lower the price, the fewer breeds there are. Mythic Legion, like previous NFT games, uses a burning process to keep the game's environment in check.
