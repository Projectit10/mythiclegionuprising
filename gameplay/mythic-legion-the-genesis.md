# Mythic Legion: The Genesis

Once in the mythical land of Firipins, there was the most powerful creature of all. He ruled over the land, seas, sky, and even the underworld. Everyone called him by the name Bathala.

The time came when he was about to take his rest which would last billions of years. He decided to create a pair of creatures who would work together to rule his land in replacement of him while he was at rest. He spoke with his majestic voice echoed all over the land, uttering these words:

**“With all my might, to this land would bring fright. I command two creatures almighty, be conceived in the essence of unity.”**

**“Both be wielded with magnificent powers, to Sultanaria and Gaoraja they would be rulers”**

The entire land trembled as the sky opened up and the land started to split up. From them, appeared two magnificent creatures that left everyone astounded by its view. Tohan, the first creation, ruled over the Sultanaria Legion while the second one, Abbadon, dominated the Gaoraja Legion. Harmony and peace governed all over the land as the legions ascended.

Unfortunately, this didn’t last as strife transpired. The conflict emerged from Tohan being looked up to, by all of his glorious creations and even those who are under the Gaoraja Legion praised him.

**“Tohan, every single mouth speaks his name as if he was the only ruler in this land! I gave you power and you shall only bow down to me! All of you who despised me shall be worthy of dreadful punishment!“**

This came out of Abbadon’s mouth as he expressed his exasperation with the Gaorajans who turned their backs from him.

As time went by, Gaorajans slowly shifted to the Sultanaria Legion in search of better lives out there. With the decreasing size of his legion, Abbadon got enraged. As his envy grew stronger and stronger, causing his powers to be influenced by dark sinister force, Abbadon prompted a war against the Sultanaria Legion. He captured some of Tohan’s creations and cursed them with his corrupted powers.

**”The heavens that bestows, let this power of mine grow. Scatter a desire on every soul, destruction come fall. Those whom turned their back on me with death they shall be. Forthwith, unfathomable creation, rise and ruin this Legion.”**

Abbadon continued cursing the Sultanarians with his corrupted power and the once peaceful land turned into a wicked one. Tohan, concerned with his brother, tried to stop his plan and told him,

**"Brother, do not let greed and pride blind you from your purpose. This is not you! We must maintain the balance or everything would be meaningless."**

Abbadon continued and with the tremendous voice and a bloodshed eye shouted,

**“The Land would be filled with hate and oppression as you, Bathala, won’t even like to visit your own throne to peep on the land that once was your sanctuary, and you my greatest nemesis will soon vanish on this realm.”**

Then suddenly, a roar of Lightning strikes from the heavens, the leaves on the land fall from its vines as if autumn starts in a split second in the midst of summer. The water from the rivers that reflects one’s beauty darkened as if it’s contaminated by a leak from the sludge.

**“With the power bestowed upon me, I shall make this land a horrifying dwelling place. Every creature would desire these excruciating strengths. They would never cease battling against each other to death, aspiring to be the strongest one.“ Abbadon continued.**

Tohan responded with conviction,

**"I warned you, I will have no other choice but to stand for the people and fight! Whatever it takes!"**

Brace yourselves, for this will be a historic rebellion; the birth of the unending warfare between the mythic legions!
