# Sorcerer

## OVERVIEW

**SORCERERS** often rely on their instincts and intelligence. Some are born with innate magical abilities while others need to study and train. They were able to wield magic by means of studying or harnessing powers from supernatural sources around them. When in the field of battle they do not hesitate to unleash their powerful magic, defeating their enemy even from afar.



## Marah

#### **Attack Type:** Long Range

**Appearance:** The diwatas appear as regular human beings except for some distinct features. They do not possess a philtrum and they are absent of any wrinkles on their body. They also seem ageless. They're considered to be one of the most beautiful beings. The color of their skin is pale, which during pre-colonial times many believed that to be a sign of supernatural abilities. She is wearing white dress and flowers in her head.

#### **Skills**

* **Woodland God (Passive Skill)** - Diwata receives blessing from the forest god every 30 seconds. In 4 seconds after taking damage from enemies, Diwata receives barrier and slows down enemies beside her.
* **Doe Restoration -** She has a deer with healing antlers, the player needs to focus the skill on an ally. There is a range for the position of the deer, if it is too far away from you the deer will return and cancel the healing, while the deer heals Marah is also included in the heal. For example, she sends the deer to her ally to heal with 5% HP per 3 seconds. She can heal herself when she casts the skill in the air or when she doesn't use it on her ally (the heal is higher when it’s only her, it can be 10% HP or 8%).
* **Forest Power** - Diwata casts spell and unleashes animals from the forests and take damage to nearby enemies. Enemies slows down for 3 seconds.
* **Ultimate: Deadly Flowers** - Diwata summons deadly flowers from the forest upon nearby enemies. Magic damage increases and also healing nearby allies 10%HP



## Corazon

**Attack Type**: Long Range

**Appearance:** A Mangkukulam, although it is not seen often, looks like an ugly old woman with long greyish hair, and long dirty nails. A mangkukulam can be an ordinary person employing or using the art of “kulam”. “Kulam” or “kulamin” means to bewitch or place a hex. The mangkukulam, as with their western counterpart “the witches” or “sorcerers” can recite spells and mix potions. They are also known to use dolls and needles to remotely hex a victim.

#### Skills

* **Puppeteer (Passive Skill)-** When casting other skills, this mage hero will collect up to 4 bars of strands of hair. Then, she will produce a stringed puppet that will help her attack. The damage dealt by this skill increases as Corazon’s level goes up. Moreover, enemies near a killed opponent that receive damage from Corazon’s puppet are also cursed by this spell.
* **Dolled down** - Corazon marks an enemy using basic attack and then launches her puppet in a designated area. Striking it with a needle can stun nearby opponents for 2 seconds. Corazon can only adjust the position of her puppet once while only dragging the marked opponent the same way her puppet is moved .The doll acts as a conduit of pain, transferring the actions performed on the doll onto the enemy’s body.
* **Glim** - Casting this creates a circle of 6 candles around an opponent, burning the enemy and his nearby allies with black flame for 5 seconds, dealing 10% magic damage. Corazon increases movement speed for 2 seconds.
* **Ultimate: Black Magic** - Corazon temporarily disables her second skill in exchange for her ultimate. Rather than using the six candles to the enemy, she will use the black flame from it to create a potion which she throws in an area. This will release a shadow that stays behind the enemy for 3.5 seconds, it deals 5% damage (increases with Corazon’s level) and slows the enemy for 1.5 second. If enemy heroes inflict CC effect on Corazon during her Ultimate, they will be silenced for 1.5 seconds. This effect has a cooldown of 4 seconds. She will be able to use her second skill again once the shadow entity is gone.

#### NOTES

* Being silenced will not be triggered if the enemy hero that applied the crowd control effect was not in Corazon's attack range.
* When Corazon is stunned, her first skill and Ultimate can be cancelled.
* Corazon’s first skill cannot be purified (if there will be a spell like that) but it can be cancelled if the enemy moves away from Corazon’s range.
