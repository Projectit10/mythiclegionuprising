# Sorcerer

OVERVIEW

**SORCERERS** often rely on their instincts and intelligence. Some are born with innate magical abilities while others need to study and train. They were able to wield magic by means of studying or harnessing powers from supernatural sources around them. When in the field of battle they do not hesitate to unleash their powerful magic, defeating their enemy even from afar

## CORAZON (Female)

**Role:** Sorcerer

**Attack Type**: Long Range

**Appearance:** A Mangkukulam, although it is not seen often, looks like an ugly old woman with long greyish hair, and long dirty nails. Her clothes are always plain and/or dark colored with chants/curses embroidered. She always carries creepy dolls, either made from dry wheatgrass or wood and is stabbed with nails or needles. Her teeth are all black even her tongue. Her eyes turn full black whenever she does rituals. Her back is slightly bent.

#### Skills:

* **Puppeteer (Passive Skill)-** When casting other skills, this mage hero will collect up to 4 bars of strands of hair. Then, she will produce a stringed puppet that will help her attack. The damage dealt by this skill increases as Corazon’s level goes up. Moreover, enemies near a killed opponent that receive damage from Corazon’s puppet are also cursed by this spell.
* **Dolled down** - Corazon marks an enemy using a basic attack and then launches her puppet in a designated area. Striking it with a needle can stun nearby opponents for 2 seconds. Corazon can only adjust the position of her puppet once while only dragging the marked opponent the same way her puppet is moved. The doll acts as a conduit of pain, transferring the actions performed on the doll onto the enemy’s body.
* **Glim** - Casting this creates a circle of 6 candles around an opponent, burning the enemy and his nearby allies with a black flame for 5 seconds, dealing 10% magic damage. Corazon increases movement speed for 2 seconds.
* **Ultimate: Black Magic** - Corazon temporarily disables her second skill in exchange for her ultimate. Rather than using the six candles to the enemy, she will use the black flame from it to create a potion which she throws in an area. This will release a shadow that stays behind the enemy for 3.5 seconds, it deals 5% damage (increases with Corazon’s level) and slows the enemy for 1.5 seconds. If enemy heroes inflict CC effect on Corazon during her Ultimate, they will be silenced for 1.5 seconds. This effect has a cooldown of 4 seconds. She will be able to use her second skill again once the shadow entity is gone.

#### NOTES:

* Being silenced will not be triggered if the enemy hero that applied the crowd control effect was not in Corazon's attack range.
* When Corazon is stunned, her first skill and Ultimate can be canceled.
* Corazon’s first skill cannot be purified (if there will be a spell-like that) but it can be canceled if the enemy moves away from Corazon’s range.
