# Guild

In Mythic Legion: Uprising, the guild is a group of players who have gathered together to form an organization. Guilds support the strengthening of bonds between players in situations where the guild's growth and collection of valuable rewards require the participation of all members. By categorizing competitions on a level between groups of players, guilds generate a more challenging environment.

**Guild Leaderboard**

The total Point will be used to rank the guilds against one another. The higher the Guild rank, the more difficult it is for members to collect Points. To ensure fairness between the new Guild and the old Guild, the Guild Leaderboard will be reset at the start of each new season.
